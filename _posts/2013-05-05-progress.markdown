This week I finally successfully launched the original Greebles running on an
old eMac that I found! Now I’ll be able to compare to the original as I develop
the modernized version.

Turns out that good documentation is kind of hard to find when it comes to
getting classic mode running on OS X 10.4, after lots of searching I finally
found this page that lays it out extremely well. Hopefully it’s of use to
someone else at some point. :)

Next it’s back to framework development for the game. Stay tuned. :)
