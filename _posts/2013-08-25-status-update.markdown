Remember a while back when I said there were only three parts of the project?
Turns out there’s a few more than that. :) Not only is there a form for Setup
and Custom Game Settings, but also for clearing the high score list, (Zap)
joining a network game, and displaying errors.

I’ve spent the past couple of weekends working on those, but they’re pretty
much done now! Here’s a screenshot of each of them:

Setup: ![](/assets/img/setup.png)

Custom Game Settings: ![](/assets/img/custom-game-settings.png)

Join Network Game: ![](/assets/img/join-network-game.png)

Zap High Scores: ![](/assets/img/are-you-sure.png)

Error Dialog: ![](/assets/img/error.png)

For the most part, they’re pretty simple, it just took some time. But now
they’re all done, and they have everything in place to interface with the game
itself, which is actually what I’ve been looking at next.

I’ve started working on designing the game itself this week. I’m mostly just
throwing ideas around and seeing if they would work/fit with all the different
needs, but it’s still really fun! Especially when I think about how the AI is
going to work, but that’s still a ways down the road. Right now I’m thinking
more about the game state machine, and how I’m going to build the menu system.
Hopefully in the next month or so, (school permitting) I’ll have the menus in
place and wired up to some of the dialogs I created up above. Huzzah!
